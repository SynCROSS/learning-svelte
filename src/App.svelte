<script>
  import AudioPlayer from './AudioPlayer.svelte';
</script>

<p>
  In all the examples we've seen so far, the &lt;script&gt; block contains code
  that runs when each component instance is initialised. <br /> For the vast
  majority of components, that's all you'll ever need. <br /> Very occasionally,
  you'll need to run some code outside of an individual component instance.
  <br />
  For example, you can play all five of these audio players simultaneously; it
  would be better if playing one stopped all the others. <br /> We can do that
  by declaring a &lt;script context="module"&gt; block. <br /> Code contained
  inside it will run once, when the module first evaluates, rather than when a
  component is instantiated. <br />
